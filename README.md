# Note Taker Application

## Description

This application allows users to add, store, and delete notes. Each note comes with a note title and note description so it is easily accessible to read at a further time. I contributed to the code by creating the backend and connecting it to the frontend. I was able to further use my express.js skills. The entire application has been deployed to Heroku.
